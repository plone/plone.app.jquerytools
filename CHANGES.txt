Changelog
=========

1.4b1 - unreleased
------------------
- Added a link in the close button to improve accessibility
  [giacomos]

- Fix sed command in jqt_checkout_build script to work on Linux and OSX.
  [thet]

- Update to jQueryTools 1.2.6.
  [smcmahon] 

- For overlays that are not already inline, insert them inline after the
  triggering element rather than at the end of the body. This solves an
  accessibility problem for screen readers (see ticket #12123), but is
  going to require more css reset work for overlay styling.
  [smcmahon]

1.3 - 2011-06-27
----------------

- Add events triggering so you can hook into it more.
  [vangheem]

- Don't break if a formselector was specified but the overlay has no form.
  [davisagli]

- Refactor setup of AJAX-loaded content so it's easier to call from custom
  code.
  [davisagli]

- It's now possible to repeatedly apply prepOverlay to the same element
  and have the last-applied case win. Previously, once prepOverlay had been
  used on an element, all subsequent uses on that element were ignored.
  [smcmahon]

- Add documentation in README for using jQuery Tools event handlers.
  [smcmahon]

  on close. Less DOM clutter.
  [smcmahon]

  a little easier for folks who want to read the source. The .min.js
  versions will go into the browser resources.
  [smcmahon]

  [garbas]

1.1.2 - 2010-07-19
------------------

- Avoid use of genericsetup:upgradeSteps (plural), which doesn't work in Plone
  3.

  Plone 3.
  [davisagli]

  [smcmahon]


1.1b5 - 2010-06-12
------------------

- Update to jQuery Tools 1.2.3.
  [smcmahon]

- Recode to one "var" per function standard.
  [smcmahon]

- Don't show empty ajax form responses, even if "noform" is not set.
  [smcmahon]


1.1b4 - 2010-06-06
------------------

- The select technique used to filter ajax response in b1-b3 was not robust
  if the responseText was not well-formed (think ZMI forms). Fixed by emulating
  the technique used in jQuery's .load method.
  [smcmahon]


1.1b3 - 2010-06-03
------------------

- Switch back to "find", undoing 1.1b2 change. 'filter' does not find
  descendents, and will thus not work in most validation error situations.
  Also, cleaned up identifiers and comments that suggested that we were
  filtering rather than selecting.
  [smcmahon]


1.1b2 - 2010-06-03
------------------

- Fix regression in filtering introduced in 1.1b1.
  [davisagli]


1.1b1
-----

  can handle file uploads. Bump version # to reflect significant change.
  [davisagli, smcmahon]


1.0rc3
------

- Update to tools 1.2.2. (Trivial changes)
  [smcmahon]

- Set max-height on ajax overlays to 75% of the viewport's height; switch
  to fixed positioning on everything but IE6.
  [smcmahon]

- Updated to tools 1.2.1; removed jqt image resources (too bulky
  to justify as part of main distribution).
  [smcmahon]


1.0rc2
------

- Change query string variable for ajax loads from "rand" to "ajax_load"
  to clarify its purpose.

- Added cssclass option for prepOverlay.


1.0rc1
------

- Add responseText to parameters passed in the redirect callback; this
  enables smarter redirects in cases where pages may have disappeared.
  [smcmahon]

- Add 'link-overlay' class to overlay triggers.
  [davisagli]

- Made the closing of an ajax overlay delete the loaded content so that it
  doesn't muddy up the DOM. [smcmahon]

- Added 'source' to data_parent to be able to access source element (element
  on original page, which raised the overlay window) eg. in afterpost handler.
  [naro]

- Add message for ajax no response from server.
  [smcmahon]

- Insert overlays in the DOM at the end of body rather than visual
  portal wrapper. Fixes #10307.
  [smcmahon]


1.0b17
------

  Fixed. [smcmahon]

  [smcmahon]


1.0b15 - 2010-02-17

-------------------

- Add beforepost and afterpost callback options for ajax forms.
  [smcmahon]

- Change reload strategy to set location to current href rather than using
  reload, which can cause repost queries on some browsers.
  [smcmahon]


1.0b13 - 2010-01-22
-------------------

- Fixed marshaling of submit buttons on AJAX submit when form has multiple
  buttons.
  [smcmahon]


1.0b12 - 2010-01-11
-------------------

- Allow noform and redirect options to be specified as callback functions.
  This will allow building in more smarts about what to do when ajax
  forms finish.

  [davisagli]
